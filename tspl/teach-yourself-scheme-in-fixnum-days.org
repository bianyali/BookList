* Enter Scheme
* Data types

  A data type is a collection of related values. These collections need not to be disjoint, and they are often hierarchical. Scheme has a rich set of data types: some are simple (indivisible) data types and others are compound data types made by combining other data types.

   The simple data types of Scheme include booleans, numbers, characters, and symbols.
