* 4 Scribbling Documentation

  The scribble/manual language and associated libraries provide extensive support for documenting Racket libraries. The most significant aspect of support for documentation is _the way that source-code bindings are connected to documentation sites through the module namespaceâ€”a connection_ that is facilitated by the fact that *Scribble documents are themselves modules that reside in the same namespace*. Getting Started with Documentation provides an introduction to using Scribble for documentation, and the remaining sections document the relevant libraries and APIs in detail.
