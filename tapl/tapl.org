* 1 Introduction

** 1.1 Types in Computer Science

** 1.2 What Types Systems Are Good For

*** Detecting Errors

    The most obvious benefit of static typechecking is that it always early detection of some programming errors.

*** Abstraction

   More *abstraction* thinking about *interfaces* generally leads to better design.

*** Documentation

    Types are also useful when reading programs. The type declarations in procedure headers and module interfaces constitute a form of documentation, giving useful hints about behavior.
